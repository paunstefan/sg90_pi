# sg90_pi

Raspberry Pi library for the SG90 servo

The SG90 is a lightweight and cheap servo motor that can rotate aproxiamately 180 degrees.

Like many servo motors the rotation is controlled by a PWM signal, which in this case will be generated by the PWM pins on the RPi (check the rppal crate for more info on this).

PWM signals have a frequency and a duty cycle, both can be measured in milliseconds. The frequency is how long a whole cycle is, and the duty cycle represents how long the voltage stays high.

In the SG90â€™s case, the operating frequency is 50Hz (20ms) and the duty cycle controls the angle. 0.5ms for -90 degrees, 1.5ms for 0 degrees and 2.5ms for 90 degrees.

# Usage

All you need to do to operate the motor is initialize it and
then set the desired angle (in degrees or radians).
```rust
use std::{thread, time::Duration};
use sg90_pi::SG90;

fn main() {
    let mut pin = SG90::new(rppal::pwm::Channel::Pwm0, 0.0).unwrap();
    pin.set_angle_deg(-90).unwrap();
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1s000));
    pin.set_angle_deg(90).unwrap();
 }
 ```
